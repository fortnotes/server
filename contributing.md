## Issues ##

Try to be the most specific possible. Give your OS, Node.js, application, database and packages info.
Give an example that will help other people to replicate your problem.


## Pull Requests ##

They are always welcomed but with respect to the adopted [code style](https://github.com/DarkPark/jscs) and included [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) rules.
Your patches must pass all the tests. If adding a new feature, don't forget about adding it to documentation (readme.md) and add tests for it.
